# Agricultural Pest Classification using Deep Learning 
The project "Agricultural Pests Image Classification" aims to develop a deep-learning model to classify 12 different types of agricultural pests based on images. The project uses the sequential model to leverage the customized Inception-V3 model.
The project also utilizes data augmentation techniques to improve the generalization capability. The model is implemented using TensorFlow and Keraslibraries and trained on a dataset consisting of 5494 images of pests where 4395 images are used while training and 1099 while testing. The evaluation metric used toassess the model's performance include accuracy, loss, validation accuracy andvalidation loss.
The project demonstrates the effectiveness of deep learning in solving real-world problems, such as pest classification, and provides a useful tool for farmers and agricultural researchers to identify and control pest infestations in their crops.
